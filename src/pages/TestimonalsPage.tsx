    review:
      "This is a very good bookâ€”in fact, an excellent book. Solving this requires deep conceptual clarity, so beginners should be cautious and focus on mastering the fundamentals first. If you are preparing for the JEE Advanced, consider using this book in the final stages, 45 days before the advanced level, to improve your preparation.",

    review:
      "We need to admire the thought process behind each solution. Every question has received exceptionally good solutions. I initially thought 349/- would be too much for this book, but now I realise it's worth it. A superb book for problems. He demonstrated new theorems, such as Shoelace and Vivian, in a comprehensible manner. New concepts like the mirror concept and the reduction concept in probability are just mind-blowing. Kudoz!",
